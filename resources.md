It makes package management and deployment significantly easier.

We recommend installing the newest version (Python 3.5 at this time.)

If you need to use an earlier version of Python for some specific project you can always install it in a new environment.

### Jupyter

Anaconda also installs Jupyter, the new version of iPython notebooks newly designed to support other Data Science friendly languages such as R and Julia. (**Ju**lia, **Pyt**hon, and **R**)

Jupyter notebooks are self-contained projects with data, code, graphs, and formatted text that make it easier to show your work to others.
