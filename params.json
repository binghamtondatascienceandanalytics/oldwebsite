After our “Intent to Charter” is approved by the SA EVP, we expect to have a GIM during the first two weeks of the semester.  After that we will have weekly meetings with workshops and lightning talks by members of the group.  We will also organize hackathons and participate in data science competitions to work on team projects and develop our data science portfolios.  We will work with other groups on campus to bring in outside speakers from industry and academia.\r\n\r\nWe are open to all students on campus.  Yes we are required to say it, but we really mean it.  If you expect to be working with data in your career, then you should think about attending.  So far we have Math, Economics, Management, Biology, and Computer Science majors to name a few.\r\n\r\nGraduate students are welcome too.  Although an SA charter requires that the officers and 80% of the eboard be undergraduates, we welcome the knowledge and experience that graduate students can bring to our meetings.\r\n\r\n### What is Data Science?\r\nData science is an interdisciplinary field about processes and systems to extract knowledge or insights from data in various forms, either structured or unstructured, which is a continuation of some of the data analysis fields such as statistics, data mining, and predictive analytics.\r\n\r\n### What is Analytics?\r\nAnalytics is the discovery, interpretation, and communication of meaningful patterns in data.\r\n\r\n### Some of the tools we will be using:\r\n* R and RStudio \r\n* Python using the Anaconda data science package installer with Jupyter notebooks\r\n* SQL – PostgreSQL or Microsoft SQL Server Express\r\n* Excel and PowerPivot\r\n\r\n### Events:\r\n* **GIM** – Late August or Early September TBD\r\n* **Weekly Meetings** – TBD\r\n\r\n### What you can do:\r\n* Tell your friends, talk it up, help with publicity\r\n* Give a lightning talk – What you did on your Summer internship\r\n* Teach a workshop or assist others\r\n* Volunteer to serve on the eboard",
