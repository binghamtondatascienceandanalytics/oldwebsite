<p>We are a new group forming on campus in Fall 2016.  After our “Intent to Charter” is approved by the SA EVP, we expect to have a GIM during the first two weeks of the semester.  After that we will have weekly meetings with workshops and lightning talks by members of the group.  We will also organize hackathons and participate in data science competitions to work on team projects and develop our data science portfolios.  We will work with other groups on campus to bring in outside speakers from industry and academia.</p>

<p>We are open to all students on campus.  Yes we are required to say it, but we really mean it.  If you expect to be working with data in your career, then you should think about attending.  So far we have Math, Economics, Management, Biology, and Computer Science majors to name a few.</p>

<p>Graduate students are welcome too.  Although an SA charter requires that the officers and 80% of the eboard be undergraduates, we welcome the knowledge and experience that graduate students can bring to our meetings.</p>
